                Welcome Message
                Section 0 | Welcome to Foothill College Fall 2023
                Foothill College uses the CanvasLinks to an external site. course management system to deliver all online and hybrid courses. 

                In Canvas, you will access online lessons, course materials, and additional resources.

                Icon 7-1.svgNew to online learning or Foothill College?
                If you are new to online learning make sure to visit the Online Learning websiteLinks to an external site. to see how to get started and see what skills you will need.

                We’ll be using Canvas for course material, major assignments, grades, and the class schedule. The easiest way to log into Canvas is through MyPortal. 

                How do I log into Canvas?Links to an external site.
                Find out about the Canvas orientationsLinks to an external site.
                You can also log in to Canvas directly which is really useful when MyPortal is down ( https://foothillcollege.instructure.com).

                Icon7.svgWhat are the technology requirements?
                To participate in this class, you will need to have regular access to a computer with a reliable internet connection so that you can access Canvas at least three times a 
                week. You will also need a word processing program capable of saving word formats, such as .doc, .docx, or .pdf. You may also use Google Docs.

                In our Canvas course, I have set up a page titled "Technology Support & Computer Resources" with more information on basic computer requirements, plug-ins, and helper applications.

                Icon 7-2.svgHow do I avoid getting dropped?
                Great question! 

                If you decide to drop the course, you must go on MyPortal to officially drop from the course, or you may receive a grade of 'F.' You may also go to the Admissions Office yourself.

                To continue in this class, you must participate weekly in all areas: assignments, quizzes, exams, and discussion forums. You do not need a code from me to drop a course. 
                However, I would appreciate hearing from you before you make the decision to drop a course. Often, we can work out a solution to help you stay in the course.

                The deadline to add and drop classes may vary per course. Generally, the deadline to add or drop a course without a W-mark is prior to 20 percent of class meetings or prior to the end of the second week of instruction for a 12-week course.

                To determine the exact drop date for your course, consult the Academic Calendar on the Foothill websiteLinks to an external site..

                You're responsible for initiating the official add/drop process and for notifying both the instructor and Admissions & Records OfficeLinks to an external site.. Do not rely on an instructor (me!) to add you to a course or drop you if you stop attending. To ensure that you are properly registered or dropped from a class and do not receive a substandard grade,  you are responsible for dropping the class by the appropriate deadline.

                Icon 12-1.svgIncomplete
                For a justifiable, approved reason (serious illness, emergency, etc.), you may ask your instructor for more time to complete coursework. After the end of the eighth week and before the end of the quarter, you must request that the instructor assign a grade of Incomplete (I). The instructor files an Incomplete Contract that explains the reason and precisely outlines the work due, procedure required, and the due date for you to complete the work. You should sign and keep a copy of the contract.

                The college does not assign an Incomplete because a student is slow or negligent in submitting required work. If you meet the course requirements within one calendar year, the I grade may be changed; otherwise, it may be listed as F.

                untitled-1.svgRespect
                Respect and recognition of others in our class should be reflected and embodied by all within our classroom community. I will not hesitate to provide appropriate action to anyone who is communicating (in any fashion) disrespect, prejudice, or discrimination to others in our class and cultures outside of our class. I will not stand for speech that promotes racism, sexism, classism, residency status (immigration), or homophobia. If at any time you feel or experience someone else’s discomfort with such issues, talk with me about it. In cases of class order and disruption (being any action or attempted action that negatively distracts or affects the class community, individual students, or the instructor), the following procedures will be followed:

                I, as the instructor, will ask the student(s) causing the disruption to cease and desist.
                I, as the instructor, will notify the disruptor(s) of possible suspension and/or dismissal from the class.
                If disruption does not cease, I, as the instructor, will follow the procedures as established in Foothill’s Student Code of Conduct.Links to an external site.

                Icon 5.svg5 Tips
                Taking an online course is different than going to a classroom, and to be successful you'll need to strengthen skills like working independently, budgeting your time and staying organized.

                Here are 5 basic tips to help you make the most of your time online:

                Set a weekly study schedule - and stick to it. Completing the reading, discussion posts and assignments in an online class can be challenging, especially when you're juggling multiple responsibilities. It's no coincidence that one study found that 79% of students identified time management as critical to their online success.
                Create a study space. Finding a space to work where you won’t be disturbed and can set up (at your house, in the library or wherever works for you) will help you stay focused and keep your study materials organized.
                Get started on readings and assignments early. Students often say the "need the pressure" of waiting until the last minute, but the truth is procrastinating causes unnecessary stress and leads to less-than-quality work.
                Communicate regularly with your instructor. Besides getting your questions answered, establishing a working relationship with your instructor is essential for expanding your professional network and developing a list of references you can use for career purposes. (Your instructor really does want to help you!)
                Engage with your classmates. You'll increase your chances of online success if you don't feel like a solo student doing homework online. Building even a few supportive connections with classmates will help you be more engaged, develop positive attitudes towards the class, and makes the environment feel safer for sharing.

                Resources and Code is Everywhere!

                There are many great resources and places to go for help (including stackoverflow and others).
                Getting help from online resources is okay to do!
                People in the real world do this all the time.
                It's actually a good skill to be able to find information you need online.
                However… in school, we're typically working on the actual coding skill, not the skill of finding information!
                So how can I use these resources?

                When you have a problem, get help!

                Ask me!
                Post to the discussion board
                Ask another student, tutor, TA, colleague, etc.
                Look in the textbook or other books
                Look online
                Then, put the help/resource away.

                Close the book
                Close the browser
                Turn off your phone
                Remove the resource from your sight
                Write the code yourself.
                When you have a problem, get help!

                Then, put the help/resource away.
                Write the code yourself.
                Using this approach, you will:

                Ensure that you understand the topic/code/solution
                Be able to explain the code
                Act with integrity
                Learn! 
                Academic Honesty

                Academic Integrity
                Section 0 | Academic Integrity
                Icon 13.svgWhat is academic integrity?
                Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. We as instructors and you are expected to obey rules of honest scholarship.

                Academic misconduct--cheating--is not just "against the rules." It violates the assumptions at the heart of all learning. It destroys the mutual trust and respect that should exist between student and professor. It is unfair to students who earn their grades honestly.

                Academic integrity at Foothill College
                Your own commitment to learning, as evidenced by your enrollment at Foothill College, and the Student Honesty Policy requires you to be honest in all your academic course work. You should, therefore, submit your own, original work for this course.

                Consequently, an instance of academic misconduct (e.g., plagiarism, cheating, taking credit for others’ work, submitting work for another course as work for this one, etc.) will likely result in disciplinary action, which may include a recommendation for dismissal and a failing course grade. Some assignments may go through Turnitin.com, a plagiarism detecting software.

                Upholding academic integrity means:
                Developing and conveying your own ideas in course work;
                Identifying all sources of information;
                Acknowledging collaboration when assignments aren't completed independently;
                Accurately reporting results when conducting your own research or with respect to labs;
                Honesty during quizzes and exams.

                For this class you should be working with a local installation of MySQL, I am assuming a default installation of MySQL 8.0 or higher with InnoDB tables and strict mode.

                Important:

                Note that during the installation and configuration of MySQL Community Server, you will be asked to provide a password for the root user account.

                Root is the name of the default MySQL administrator account. Be sure you provide the password when prompted, and be sure to remember this password! The username Root comes from the UNIX and Linux operating systems, where it is the name of the default system administrator account.

                You should always set a password for the root account, and you need to write down that password someplace secure.

                After installing MySQL 8.0, run the MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE app using whatever method you prefer for running an app. On the MySQL Workbench opening window, you notice links where you may browse MySQL documentation, access a MySQL blog, and participate in forums related to MySQL. On this main window, you also see a list of the MySQL connections currently available to you. The one connection listed is to the server created during the installation of MySQL.

                Watch: Running MySQL Workbench on Windows

                Click on the connection box Local instance MySQL80 . MySQL80 was the default name given during installation if you accepted the defaults. The name may be different if you changed the name during installation. Next provide the password to access the server you created during installation.

                61689_ch03_02-t2.png  

                

                Once you have successfully submitted the password for the connection, you are given access to the main MySQL Workbench environment for that connection.

                61689_ch03_03-t2.png 

                

                Remember that MySQL Workbench is a very powerful tool that contains many features. We only use the SQL editor within the MySQL Workbench for our purposes. Therefore, we can simplify, or unclutter, the window by hiding some of the panes. The two panes we would like to hide are the Navigation pane and the MySQL Additions pane. To hide these two panes, 

                61689_ch03_04-t2.png

                Before creating a database on our own, we can first get used to the MySQL Workbench environment by entering a simple SQL command and going through the process to have it executed. MySQL has internal databases it uses to handle its internal processing. These databases will be separate from the database we will be creating; however, they are viewable. Because we have not yet created any databases on our own, and just installed MySQL, any databases listed will be internal to MySQL. To show the databases on a MySQL server host you use the  SHOW DATABASES  command followed by a semicolon. 

                The next step is to enter the SHOW DATABASES command into the MySQL Workbench SQL editor.

                Notice as you entered the command, the keywords of  SHOW DATABASES  turn blue. This color of blue is used to represent keywords in the SQL editor within the MySQL Workbench. This color scheme is the Microsoft Windows default scheme and can be modified if preferred; however, for the remainder of the text we continue using this color of blue for keywords.

                The next step is to execute the command entered. On the main menu, select the Query menu and select Execute Current Statement.

                61689_ch03_07-t2.png 

                Although some environments may not require a semicolon to end an SQL statement, it is always good practice to do so. For in the event you are using an environment in which it is required and do not include the semicolon, an error will occur. Always follow proper coding practice for any language you are using, regardless of whether the environment is forgiving or not.

                //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

                MySQL lets you save SQL commands so you can use them again without retyping them. In MySQL, as well as in many other DBMSs, you save commands in a script file, or simply a script, which is a text file. In MySQL, script files have the .sql filename extension.

                With MySQL, you can save your scripts in the location of your choice on your local file system (such as on a hard drive or USB flash drive), therefore, creating your own repository.

                The following steps describe how to create and use scripts in the MySQL Workbench. If you are using a different version of MySQL or another DBMS, use Help, consult the system documentation, or search the Internet to determine how to accomplish the same tasks.

                

                To create a script in MySQL:
                Enter the command, or commands, you would like to comprise the script in the query pane.

                On the MySQL Workbench main menu, click on the File menu and select the Save Script As option.

                You may now navigate to a location in your file system you would like to save the script.

                Enter a name for your script in the File name: text box. Note the file type is an SQL file with an extension of .sql.

                When you are finished, click the Save button. You return to the query pane with the name of the tab being the name of your script.

                To view or edit a script in MySQL:

                On the MySQL Workbench main menu, click on the File menu and select Open SQL Script.

                Navigate to the location in your file system where the script is saved.

                Select the script and click Open.

                Your script is now in a new tab in the query pane with the name being the same name as your script.

                You may now edit the script.

                To run an existing script in MySQL (Option #1):
                On the MySQL Workbench main menu, click on the File menu and select Open SQL Script.

                Navigate to the location in your file system where the script is saved.

                Select the script and click Open.

                Your script is now in a new tab in the query pane with the name being the same name as your script.

                You may now execute the script by clicking Query on the MySQL Workbench main menu and selecting the appropriate execute option (for example, Execute (All or Selection)).

                To run an existing script in MySQL (Option #2):
                On the MySQL Workbench main menu, click on the File menu and select Run SQL Script.

                Navigate to the location in your file system where the script is saved.

                Select the script and click Open.

                In the Run SQL Script dialog box, select the Default Schema Name from the drop-down menu and click Run.

                After the results are displayed, you click on Close to close the Run SQL Script dialog box.

                When you are finished using a script and no longer need to store it, you can delete it. To delete a script in MySQL:

                Navigate to the location in your file system where the script is saved.

                Delete the file containing the script by the normal methods for your file system.

                //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

                The Contents of the MySQL Directory During the installation process, MySQL creates all the files that are needed to start the server.
                For MySQL 8.0 on Windows, the default installation directory is C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0 for installations performed with MySQL Installer. 

                MySQL stores its files under a directory called the data directory.

                Database administrators (DBAs) commonly refer to this as the datadir, which is the name of the MySQL parameter that stores the path to this directory.
                The default location for Linux distributions is /var/lib/mysql.

                You can check its location by running the following command in the MySQL instance:

                mysql> SELECT @@datadir; 
                +-----------------+ 
                | @@datadir       |

                Your installation of MySQL will install the current versions of these products.

                After you have installed MySQL, you should check regularly for updated versions of the MySQL release you are using.

                For systems running a Windows OS, this functionality is built into the MySQL Installer for Windows, and you should use this utility to check for updates and then update your MySQL installation. 

                In order to uninstall MySQL, you must:

                Backup any database schemas and data you have in your existing installation of MySQL. 
                Uninstall the installed MySQL components using the Windows 10 Control Panel
                Type Control Panel into the Windows search text box on the Task Bar, and then click the icon to launch the program.
                Remove the folder C:\Program Files\MySQL and any contents of the folder that remain after uninstalling MySQL (it should be empty).
                This folder is normally a hidden folder — use the Windows File Explorer View | Options command to change settings on hidden folders and files. You may need to restart your computer before deleting this folder if any files in it are still in use.

                Remember that MySQL Workbench is a very powerful tool that contains many features. We only use the SQL editor within the MySQL Workbench for our purposes. Therefore, we can simplify, or unclutter, the window by hiding some of the panes. The two panes we would like to hide are the Navigation pane and the MySQL Additions pane. To hide these two panes, 

                61689_ch03_04-t2.png

                Before creating a database on our own, we can first get used to the MySQL Workbench environment by entering a simple SQL command and going through the process to have it executed. MySQL has internal databases it uses to handle its internal processing. These databases will be separate from the database we will be creating; however, they are viewable. Because we have not yet created any databases on our own, and just installed MySQL, any databases listed will be internal to MySQL. To show the databases on a MySQL server host you use the  SHOW DATABASES  command followed by a semicolon. 

                The next step is to enter the SHOW DATABASES command into the MySQL Workbench SQL editor.

                Notice as you entered the command, the keywords of  SHOW DATABASES  turn blue. This color of blue is used to represent keywords in the SQL editor within the MySQL Workbench. This color scheme is the Microsoft Windows default scheme and can be modified if preferred; however, for the remainder of the text we continue using this color of blue for keywords.

                The next step is to execute the command entered. On the main menu, select the Query menu and select Execute Current Statement.

                61689_ch03_07-t2.png 

                Although some environments may not require a semicolon to end an SQL statement, it is always good practice to do so. For in the event you are using an environment in which it is required and do not include the semicolon, an error will occur. Always follow proper coding practice for any language you are using, regardless of whether the environment is forgiving or not.

                MySQL lets you save SQL commands so you can use them again without retyping them. In MySQL, as well as in many other DBMSs, you save commands in a script file, or simply a script, which is a text file. In MySQL, script files have the .sql filename extension.

                With MySQL, you can save your scripts in the location of your choice on your local file system (such as on a hard drive or USB flash drive), therefore, creating your own repository.

                The following steps describe how to create and use scripts in the MySQL Workbench. If you are using a different version of MySQL or another DBMS, use Help, consult the system documentation, or search the Internet to determine how to accomplish the same tasks.

                

                To create a script in MySQL:
                Enter the command, or commands, you would like to comprise the script in the query pane.

                On the MySQL Workbench main menu, click on the File menu and select the Save Script As option.

                You may now navigate to a location in your file system you would like to save the script.

                Enter a name for your script in the File name: text box. Note the file type is an SQL file with an extension of .sql.

                When you are finished, click the Save button. You return to the query pane with the name of the tab being the name of your script.

                To view or edit a script in MySQL:

                On the MySQL Workbench main menu, click on the File menu and select Open SQL Script.

                Navigate to the location in your file system where the script is saved.

                Select the script and click Open.

                Your script is now in a new tab in the query pane with the name being the same name as your script.

                You may now edit the script.

                To run an existing script in MySQL (Option #1):
                On the MySQL Workbench main menu, click on the File menu and select Open SQL Script.

                Navigate to the location in your file system where the script is saved.

                Select the script and click Open.

                Your script is now in a new tab in the query pane with the name being the same name as your script.

                You may now execute the script by clicking Query on the MySQL Workbench main menu and selecting the appropriate execute option (for example, Execute (All or Selection)).

                To run an existing script in MySQL (Option #2):
                On the MySQL Workbench main menu, click on the File menu and select Run SQL Script.

                Navigate to the location in your file system where the script is saved.

                Select the script and click Open.

                In the Run SQL Script dialog box, select the Default Schema Name from the drop-down menu and click Run.

                After the results are displayed, you click on Close to close the Run SQL Script dialog box.

                When you are finished using a script and no longer need to store it, you can delete it. To delete a script in MySQL:

                Navigate to the location in your file system where the script is saved.

                Delete the file containing the script by the normal methods for your file system.

                Expectations
                Icon 12-1.svgStudent Expectations
                I expect students to spend approximately 5 -8 hours per week completing course activities.

                Here is what I expect of students each week:

                Watch the provided videos while following along with the provided lecture notes and source code.
                Read the textbook.
                Complete the practice  exercises  (and post one answer to the discussion board).
                Complete the assigned exercise and submit on time.
                Let the instructor know as soon as possible if you have any concerns about getting an assignment submitted by the deadline.
                Participate in the discussion boards.
                Post questions that you have.
                Answer other students' questions when you can.
                Read the questions, answers, and discussions posted by other students.
                Do your own work
                Icon 12-2.svgInstructor Expectations
                Here is what you can expect of your instructor:

                I will respond to your email or message within 24 hours during the week, unless I inform you otherwise.
                I attempt to grade programming projects, exercises, and exams within a week of the deadline.
                I will post grades and feedback in the Canvas Gradebook.
                Icon 15.svgGraded Discussions (Extra Credit)
                By posting on the discussion board, you may earn participation points and thus extra-credit for the course. You can earn up to 2% extra credit, which will be added to your overall final grade, with the highest possible grade being 100%. There are 10 modules, so fulfilling the extra-credit requirement for each given module will earn you 0.2%. In order to meet the extra-credit requirement, you must post at least ONE answer to one of the given exercise problems for full credit. You must show your work and try your best. Do not try to edit your post as I will only grade the original post. This can boost your grade from a B to A- or from an A- to an A, so I encourage you to engage in this extra-credit opportunity.

                Every lesson includes practice exercises that are designed to:

                Establish familiarity with a concept
                Build confidence as concepts are introduced
                Get practice with and feedback on topics before you submit your project
                Allow you to experiment

                Icon 7-1.svgPlagiarism in Computer Science
                Plagiarism means representing someone else's work as your own. Plagiarism is using the ideas, text, or programming code of someone else without appropriate acknowledgement. Plagiarism also consists of allowing someone else to write or alter your own work and submit it as your work. Some examples of plagiarism/cheating:

                Copying, pasting, and submitting code from an online source as your own
                Submitting answers or code written by another student (from this quarter or a previous quarter)
                Posting an online request asking someone else to write an answer or code
                Posting an assignment or exam question to an online study site and asking someone to complete it
                Communicating with other students or any other people other than the instructors during an exam; this includes e-mail, text/instant messaging, or any other form of communication

                The activities above will result in a 0 on the assignment or exam and potential disciplinary action.

                Some guidelines to follow:

                Write your own code. This is the most important rule.
                If you receive ideas or help from a website or person, that is okay. But use those ideas to write the code yourself. I recommend reviewing the help and then putting the help away to write the answer.
                Make sure you can explain any code you submit.
                Do NOT post assignment, notes, or exams to online study sites.

                Introduction to Database Systems
                Databases and database systems are an essential component of life in modern society. Data is usually stored in a database. To implement a database and to manage its contents, you need a database management system (DBMS). The DBMS is a generalized software package for implementing and maintaining a computerized database. The database and software together form a database system.

                Structured Query Language is a computer programming language used to query relational databases as well as interact with relational database systems. Understanding the language and relational model is a vital skill necessary for anyone interested in a career in databases.

                Setting Up the Salika Database
                You can use mysql command-line client or MySQL Workbench.

                Option 1: Using MySQL WorkbenchOption 2: Using MySQL Command-Line Client
                Using MySQL Workbench to Execute SQL Queries
                To run the SQL script file, perform the following steps:

                Download sakila-schema.sql.
                From the menu, select Server → Data Import.
                Select Import from Self-Contained File and then select the ellipses (…) at the end of the file path box.
                Choose sakila-schema.sql. The file is a set of SQL commands that will import the database into the system.

                Once the import is completed, you should see all the available tables.
                Repeat steps 1- 6 to execute the sakila-data.sql file.
                Now, select the sakila database, and then right-click on the Tables tab. Select the option Refresh All to refresh the list of tables. 
                
                //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

                Setting Up the Salika Database
                You can use mysql command-line client or MySQL Workbench.

                Option 1: Using MySQL WorkbenchOption 2: Using MySQL Command-Line Client
                Using MySQL Command-Line Client Execute SQL Queries
                To load the contents of the world.sql file into MySQL, use the following procedure:

                Change directory to where the sql file is located
                If your current directory is not the same as the location of the world.sql file, use a CD command to change location.

                Connect to the MySQL server using the MySQL program
                At your command-line prompt, issue this command:

                shell> mysql --u root --p
                This command connects to the server using the MySQL root account to make sure that you'll have permission to create the world database. The --p option tells MySQL to prompt you for the root password. Enter the password when prompted. (Remember that the MySQL root account is not the same as the operating system root account and probably will have a different password.)

                Create the sakila database and select it as the default database:
                In the MySQL program, issue the following statements:

                mysql> CREATE DATABASE salika;
                mysql> USE salika;
                Load the contents of sql into the salika database

                Run a SOURCE command to tell MySQL to read and process the contents of sakila-schema.sql:

                You need to know the path to the sakila-schema.sql file in order to set it as a variable in the steps below. It is listed as "path-to" below:

                mysql> SOURCE path-to/sakila-schema.sql;
                Run a SOURCE command to tell MySQL to read and process the contents of sakila-data.sql :

                mysql> SOURCE path-to/sakila-data.sql;
                After MySQL finishes processing the sakila-schema.sql file and sakila-data.sql file, try this statement:

                mysql> SHOW TABLES;
                The output should list all the tables shown. Depending on your server configuration, SHOW TABLES may display the table names in lowercase. If so, use lowercase names whenever you refer to the tables by name later.

                To see what columns each table contains, use DESCRIBE.

                For example:

                mysql> DESCRIBE actor;
                mysql> DESCRIBE address;
                mysql> DESCRIBE category;
                mysql> DESCRIBE city;
                mysql> DESCRIBE county;
                mysql> DESCRIBE customer;
                mysql> DESCRIBE film;
                mysql> DESCRIBE film_actor;
                mysql> DESCRIBE film_category;
                mysql> DESCRIBE inventory;
                mysql> DESCRIBE language;
                mysql> DESCRIBE payment;
                mysql> DESCRIBE rental;
                mysql> DESCRIBE staff;

                Most of the SQL examples are based on the company database, so you should study it carefully.

                The full set of normalized tables for the company database is as follows:

                SCHEMA
                EMPLOYEE (fname, minit, lname ,ssn , bdate, address, sex, salary, superssn, dno)
                DEPARTMENT (dname, dnumber, mgrssn, mgrstartdate,)
                PROJECT (pname, pnumber, plocation, dnum)
                WORKS_ON (essn, pno, hours)
                DEPT_LOCATIONS (dnumber , dlocation)
                DEPENDENT (essn, dependent_name, sexr, bdate, relationship)
                Table Explanations
                The company is organized into departments. Each department has a unique name, a unique number, and a particular employee who manages the department. We keep track of the start date when that employee began managing the department. A department may have several locations.
                A department controls a number of projects, each of which has a unique name, a unique number, and a single location.
                The database will store each employee’s name, Social Security number, address, salary, sex (gender), and birth date. An employee is assigned to one department, but may work on several projects, which are not necessarily controlled by the same department. It is required to keep track of the current number of hours per week that an employee works on each project, as well as the direct supervisor of each employee (who is another employee).
                The Social Security number, or SSN, is a unique nine-digit identifier assigned to each individual in the United States to keep track of his or her employment, benefits, and taxes. Other countries may have similar identification schemes, such as personal identification card numbers.
                The database will keep track of the dependents of each employee for insurance purposes, including each dependent’s first name, sex, birth date, and relationship to the employee.

                The SQL commands needed to create the company database can be found in the following file:

                Company database scripts.zipDownload Company database scripts.zip
                To install the Company database, follow these steps:

                Extract the installation archive to a temporary location such as C:\my_scripts\ or /my_scripts/. When you unpack the archive, it creates a file named company that contains the create_tables_company_database.sql and insert_data_company_database.sql files.
                Connect to the MySQL server using the mysql command-line client with the following command:
                shell> mysql -u root -p
                        Enter your password when prompted. 

                Execute the create_tables_company_database.sql script to create the database structure, and execute the  insert_data_company_database.sql script to populate the database structure, by using the following commands:
                mysql> SOURCE  C:/my_scripts/create_tables_company_database.sql; 
                mysql> SOURCE  C:/my_scripts/insert_data_company_database.sql;

                Replace the paths to the create_tables_company_database.sql and insert_data_company_databasesql files with the actual paths on your system.

                Note
                On Windows, use slashes rather than backslashes when executing the SOURCE command.

                Confirm that the sample database is installed correctly. Execute the following statements. You should see output similar to that shown here.

                mysql> USE company;
                        Database changed.

                low angle photo of beige concrete building under cloudy sky

                Most of the discussion boards are based on the Residence Halls Database, so you should study it carefully.

                SCHEMA

                OWNERS (owner_num, last_name, first_name, address, city, state, zip_code)
                PROPERTY (property_id, office_num, address, sqr_ft, bdrms, floors, monthly_rent, owner_num)
                OFFICE (office_num, office_name, address, area, city, state, zip_code)
                SERVICE_CATEGORY (category_num, category_description)
                SERVICE_REQUEST (service_id, property_id, category_number, office_id , description, status, est_hours, spent_hours, next_service_date)
                RESIDENTS (resident_id, first_name, surname, property_id)
                Table Explanations
                Residence Halls Student Accommodation needs to maintain the services for and information of residents. There are six tables in the database: office, owner, property, service_category, service_request, and  residents.

                The SERVICE_CATEGORY table includes details of maintenance services. Residence Halls is split into two offices to better manage the properties. This management includes communicating with owners about the status of the service.
                The CATEGORY_NUM provides a unique number for the service, and category_description shows what the service is.
                The company rents out and helps to maintain 1 to 5 bedroom properties located in two main areas in the city, Columbia City and Georgetown. Each property at each location is identified by a property ID.
                Each owner is identified by a unique owner number that consists of two uppercase letters followed by a three-digit number.
                The SERVICE_REQUEST table shows requests that residents have put into the offices for maintenance.
                Residence Halls stores information about the owners of each property in the owner table. although some apartments may be owned by a couple or a family, only the primary contact is given. The resident column includes the first name and last name of each resident, along with a resident ID. The PROPERTY_ID is the unique identification number of the property in which they are staying. The property table provides details about the property associated with the PROPERTY_ID.

                What is MySQL?
                

                MySQL is an open source RDBMS that uses intuitive keywords such as SELECT, INSERT INTO, and DELETE to communicate with the database. These keywords are used in queries that instruct the server on how to handle data, how to read and write the data, or to perform operations on the database objects or the server, such as creating or modifying tables, stored procedures, functions, and views. The database objects are defined and manipulated using SQL commands and all communication and instructions issued to the database by the client applications are done using SQL code.

                The chart below illustrates the most popular database technologies. You can see that MySQL ranks high. Thus, in this course, you will learn how to use MySQL to manipulate, organize, and ultimately uncover insights within data.

                

                DAtabases.png

                MySQL has a wide range of applications in business. This includes data warehousing, inventory management, logging user sessions on web pages, and storing employee records.

                MySQL is based on the client-server model. The client-server model makes it possible for MySQL to handle concurrent connections from multiple users and host a great number of databases, each with their own tables and fine-tuned security permissions to ensure the data is only accessed by the appropriate users.

                The following figure is an example of a database in MySQL. As you can see, the database has multiple tables (countrylanguage, country, and city), and these tables are linked to each other. 

                World Database-1.jpeg

                Some popular RDBMS systems are MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle and MariaDB.

                The MySQL layers
                There are three layers in the MySQL server:

                Application layer
                Storage layer
                Physical layer
                These layers are essential for understanding which part is responsible for how your data is treated.

                The following is a graphical representation of the basic architecture of a MySQL server. It shows how the different components within the MySQL system relate to each other.

                B15386_01_7.jpeg 

                What is the MySQL Workbench?
                The MySQL Workbench is the GUI tool that is intended for use instead of the MySQL Command-Line Client. MySQL Workbench is used for application development and provides a comprehensive development environment for MySQL users and developers.

                MySQL Command-Line Client
                Accessing MySQL through the command-line interface

                MySQL is  accessible through your computer's command-line interface (CLI). This interface will allow you to quickly and easily run SQL queries against a database.

                The MySQL command line requires you to provide a username and password when you launch it.

                The -u argument specifies the username, and the -p argument specifies the password.
                So, for example, mysql -u root -p 123456 will sign into MySQL using the username, root, and the password, 123456. By default, MySQL will have an account with a username, root, and no password. So, the mysql -u root command will allow you to enter the default installation of MySQL.
                Once you have successfully launched the MySQL command line, you will see an interface that is similar to the following screenshot:

                cd C:\ Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
                Run the following command:
                mysql -u root –p
                This command is given from a command prompt, not from a MySQL
                You are prompted for your password.
                After you log into MySQL, you will see the mysql> prompt:

                Structured Query Language (SQL)
                A brief overview of SQL


                Video Recap
                SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
                SQL is the one language you should learn because most companies have some sort of online presence and keep records of data on a database. The more you know about communicating with and pulling data from the database, the better you can be at your job.
                SQL only speaks to a specific type of database, a relational database, which has tabular data. 
                The MySQL server understands Structured Query Language (SQL). Therefore, SQL is the means by which you tell the server how to perform data management operations, and fluency with it is necessary for effective communication. When you use a program such as the MySQL client, it functions primarily as a way for you to send SQL statements to the server to be executed.

                SQL vs. MySQL
                SQL and MySQL are often mistakenly used interchangeably, but they are completely different entities.

                SQL is a programming language used to retrieve or modify information in a database, while MySQL is software responsible for storing and managing data — specifically, it is a relational database management system (RDBMS).

                

                Writing SQL Commands
                A SQL statement consists of reserved words and user-defined words. 

                Reserved words are a fixed part of the SQL language and have a fixed meaning. They must be spelled exactly as required and cannot be split across lines.
                User-defined words are made up by the user and represent the names of various database objects such as tables, columns, views, indexes, et. The words in a statement are also built according to a set of syntax rules.
                Most components of a SQL statement are case-insensitive, which means that letters can be typed in either upper or lowercase. Case sensitivity rules in SQL statement depends on the operating system of the machine on which the server is running.

                Default case-sensitivity depends on which operating system you are using and how it treats file names.

                Windows file names are not case-sensitive, so a MySQL Server running on Windows does not treat database and table names as case-sensitive.
                Servers running on UNIX usually treat database and table names as case-sensitive because UNIX file names are case-sensitive.
                An exception is that names in macOS Extended file systems can be case-insensitive.
                Although SQL is free format, a SQL statement or set of statements is more readable if indentation and lineation are used. For example:

                Each clause in a statement should begin on a new line.
                The beginning of each clause should align with the beginning of other clauses.
                If a clause has several parts, they should each appear on a separate line and be indented under the start of the clause to show the relationship.
                We use the following notation to define SQL statements:

                Uppercase letters are used to represent reserved words and must be spelled exactly as shown.
                Lowercase letters are used to represent user-defined words.
                A vertical bar | indicates a choice among alternatives; for example, a | b | c .
                Curly braces { } indicate a required element; for example, {a} .
                Square brackets [ ] indicate an optional element; for example, [a] .
                An ellipsis ( ) is used to indicate optional repetition of an item zero or more times.
                Executing SQL Statements
                After you connect to the server, you can issue SQL statements for it to execute. You can select a literal or expressions.

                mysql> SELECT 'Hello World', 90*40;
                +-------------+-------+
                | Hello World | 90*40 |
                +-------------+-------+
                | Hello World |  3600 |
                +-------------+-------+
                1 row in set (0.01 sec)
                The semicolon is the most common terminator, but you can also use \g (“go”) as a synonym for the semicolon. Thus, the following examples are equivalent ways of issuing the same statement, even though they are entered differently and terminated differently:

                mysql> SELECT NOW(); 
                +---------------------+
                | NOW()               |
                +---------------------+
                | 2023-01-03 13:47:46 |
                +---------------------+
                1 row in set (0.00 sec)

                mysql> SELECT NOW()\g
                You can put more than one query on a line, and they execute one after the other. This also shows column aliases.

                mysql> SELECT 'Hello'; select now() AS "time";
                +---------------------+
                | time                |
                +---------------------+
                | 2023-01-03 13:48:31 |
                +---------------------+
                1 row in set (0.00 sec) 
                You can enter a single command on multiple lines. You get more secondary prompts until you give the semicolon delimiter followed by the Enter key.

                mysql> SELECT 'Hello'
                -> ,'World',
                -> now();
                If you have begun entering a multiple-line statement and decide that you do not want to execute it, type \c to clear (cancel) it:

                mysql> SELECT NOW(),
                -> VERSION(),
                -> \c
                mysql>
                Notice how the prompt changes back to mysql> to indicate that MySQL is ready for a new statement.

                Database organization


                

                Create a Database
                Every database is composed of one or more tables. These tables, which structure data into rows and columns, are what lend organization to the data. The keyword SCHEMA is a synonym for DATABASE.

                To create a new database, connect to the server using MySQL. Then, issue a CREATE DATABASE statement that specifies the database name:

                Syntax:

                CREATE DATABASE [IF NOT EXISTS] db_name;
                Example 1:

                Create a database with the name university.

                mysql> CREATE DATABASE world;
                Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)

                mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
                +--------------------+
                | Database           |
                +--------------------+
                | information_schema |
                | mysql              |
                | performance_schema |
                | world              |
                +--------------------+
                4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
                MySQL represents databases using directories and files in the underlying file system on the server host.

                Example 2:

                Display information about how to create a database.

                mysql> HELP CREATE DATABASE
                Name: 'CREATE DATABASE'
                Description:
                Syntax:
                CREATE {DATABASE | SCHEMA} [IF NOT EXISTS] db_name
                    [create_option] ...

                create_option: [DEFAULT] {
                    CHARACTER SET [=] charset_name
                | COLLATE [=] collation_name
                | ENCRYPTION [=] {'Y' | 'N'}
                }
                CREATE DATABASE creates a database with the given name. To use this
                statement, you need the CREATE privilege for the database. CREATE
                SCHEMA is a synonym for CREATE DATABASE.

                URL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-database.html
                
                Using a database involves several steps:

                Create the database.
                Create the tables within the database.
                Manipulate the tables by inserting, retrieving, modifying, or deleting data.
                

                Using MySQL WorkbenchUsing the Command Line
                Selecting Databases

                The USE statement selects a database to make it the default (current) database for a given session with the server:

                Syntax:

                USE db_name;
                Example 3:

                In the example below, we will select the world database.

                mysql> USE world;
                Database changed
                Once we are connected to the database server and selected a database, we are ready to type some SQL commands. The user() function returns the name and location of the current user for the connection to be made.

                mysql> SELECT user(), database();
                +----------------+------------+
                | user()         | database() |
                +----------------+------------+
                | root@localhost | world      |
                +----------------+------------+
                1 row in set (0.00 sec)
                Dropping a Database in MySQL

                To drop the database, execute the following command:

                Syntax:

                DROP DATABASE db_name;
                Example 4:

                Drop the world database.

                mysql> DROP DATABASE world;

                The CREATE TABLE statement

                

                You can check that your table exists with the show tables command. The show tables command will let you see the names of your tables. If your database does not have any tables yet, you get the response:  Empty set. If you have tables, this will show the table names.

                Example 5:

                Display all tables in the university database.

                mysql> SHOW TABLES;
                +-----------------+
                | Tables_in_world |
                +-----------------+
                | city            |
                | country         |
                | countrylanguage |
                +-----------------+
                3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
                
                What is the SQL that creates a table?
                The command to display the SQL for your table is Show Create Table.

                mysql> USE world
                Database changed

                mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE city;
                What does the table structure look like?
                Displaying the Table Structure

                Use the DESCRIBE command to display the structure of a table including column name, datatype and

                Nullability.

                Example 6:

                The DESCRIBE command will show the column names and data types for a table.

                mysql> DESCRIBE city;
                -------------+----------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
                | Field       | Type     | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
                +-------------+----------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
                | ID          | int      | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
                | Name        | char(35) | NO   |     |         |                |
                | CountryCode | char(3)  | NO   | MUL |         |                |
                | District    | char(20) | NO   |     |         |                |
                | Population  | int      | NO   |     | 0       |                |
                +-------------+----------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
                5 rows in set (0.00 sec)

                

                Populating Tables with Data (The Insert statement)
                This is done with an insert statement.  The column names in the first clause align with the data values. You do not have to do that alignment when you enter the statements. However, you do need the parentheses and the commas between items. You also need the single quotes around the character values, including the values for the dates.

                Example 7:

                Fill the City table from the university database with data.

                INSERT INTO `city` VALUES (1,'Kabul','AFG','Kabol',1780000);
                INSERT INTO `city` VALUES (2,'Qandahar','AFG','Qandahar',237500);
                INSERT INTO `city` VALUES (3,'Herat','AFG','Herat',186800);
                INSERT INTO `city` VALUES (4,'Mazar-e-Sharif','AFG','Balkh',127800);
                INSERT INTO `city` VALUES (5,'Amsterdam','NLD','Noord-Holland',731200);
                INSERT INTO `city` VALUES (6,'Rotterdam','NLD','Zuid-Holland',593321);
                Querying Tables (The Select statement)
                Now we can run the SELECT statement.

                Example 8:

                Display all information in the CITY table.

                mysql> SELECT *
                    FROM city;
                +------+------------------------------------+-------------+------------------------+------------+
                | ID   | Name                               | CountryCode | District               | Population |
                +------+------------------------------------+-------------+------------------------+------------+
                |    1 | Kabul                              | AFG         | Kabol                  |    1780000 |
                |    2 | Qandahar                           | AFG         | Qandahar               |     237500 |
                |    3 | Herat                              | AFG         | Herat                  |     186800 |
                

                List of all MySQL commands:

                Note that all text commands must be first on a new line and end with ';'

                ?           (\?) Synonym for `help'.

                Storage engines (InnoDB)
                MySQL storage engines are software modules that MySQL server uses to write, read, and update data in the database. 

                A storage engine is a handler that manages a certain kind of table. The storage engine affects the way that the data is stored in the tables and whether or not the table supports a variety of features. Table 1 describes some storage engines. Each engine has distinct features, but only InnoDB enforces referential integrity.

                InnoDB is the default engine for MySQL 5.7 for all the MySQL and information_schema databases. These two databases store and manage data using the MyISAM database engine. MyISAM was the default engine for earlier versions of the MySQL database.

                

                Type

                Description

                ISAM

                Legacy engine

                MYISAM

                Revision of ISAM engine with support for dynamic-length fields

                INNODB

                ACID-compliant transactional engine with support for foreign keys

                MEMORY

                Memory-based engine with support for hash indexes

                CSV

                Text-based engine for CSV recordsets

                ARCHIVE

                Archival storage (no modification of rows after insertion)

                NDB

                The engine for MySQL Cluster

                To see which storage engines the server knows about, use the SHOW ENGINES statement:

                Section 1 | Programming Assignment 1
                Icon 11.svgAssignment Overview
                The purpose of this assignment is to introduce the MySQL server and how to use it.

                people sitting down near table with assorted laptop computers

                Icon 12-2.svgLearning Objectives
                Upon completion, in addition to gaining familiarity with some common SQL commands, you will also be able to:

                Write SQL statements
                Use the MySQL command line client
                Execute a few SQL queries
                Write a script
                Create SQL Files (Windows)Create SQL Files (MacOS)Assignment 1 (Windows) Assignment 1 (MacOS)
                What is SQL Scripts?
                A SQL script is a set of SQL commands saved as a file in SQL Scripts. A SQL script can contain one or more SQL statements. Scripts can be created in MySQL workbench or in any other ASCII text editor. The file extension .sql should be used so that such files are identifiable by MySQL workbench and command line.

                How to Find the Path of a File on Windows
                Click the Start button and then Computer. Click to open the location of the desired file, hold down the Shift key and right-click the file.
                On the menu, there are two options to choose from that will allow you to either copy or view the entire file path: 
                Copy as Path: Click this option to paste the full file path into a document.
                Properties: Click this option to immediately view the full file path (location).
                Step 11.png

                Creating and Using a Script File
                Sublime Text.

                Sublime Text is a shareware text and source code editor available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

                To create a script file:                            

                Open a script file in the text editor and fill in the SQL commands for each query.
                Test them in the interactive MySQL client.
                Enter the SQL query in the script file. Copy and paste it into the client window to run and test.
                If the SQL runs correctly, then save the .txt file and go on to the next query.
                If the SQL query is incorrect, then correct it in the text editor and copy it again.
                Save the script periodically as you work. 
                SQL File.png

                Save MySQL Results to a File
                Create a new folder my_scripts.
                Put the script file yourname_assignment1.sql in the folder C:\ my_scripts.
                In order to run the sql file yourname_assignment1.sql and create your .txt file, choose one of the following methods:

                Method 1:

                Click on the Start
                In the search box, type the following:
                cmd
                search-cmd-prompt-1.jpeg

                Click on Command Prompt in the search results listing.
                Use these commands:
                Change the directory to C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin

                (The default installation directory is C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin)

                cd C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
                Run the following command:

                mysql -u root –p --force --comments –vvv
                This command is given from a command prompt, not from a MySQL
                You are prompted for your password.
                After you log into MySQL, you will see the mysql> prompt
                mysql>
                Step1W.png

                Use the tee command to put your output in a .txt file.
                You will need to know the path to the my_scripts directory in order to set it as a variable in the steps below. It is listed as "path-to" below:
                mysql> tee path-to/yourname_assignment1.txt
                Example:

                mysql> tee C:\Users\moela\OneDrive\Desktop\my_scripts\yourname_assignment1.txt

                Run the .sql file
                mysql> source C:\Users\moela\OneDrive\Desktop\my_scripts\yourname_assignment1.sql
                Step 2W.png

                Step 3W.png

                Type in notee to stop the tee command:
                mysql> notee
                You can use either QUIT or EXIT to exit the MySQL Monitor.
                mysql> exit;
                Step 1W.png

                The yourname_assignment1.txt file contains the results of all the queries.

                


                Method 2: 

                Change the directory to C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
                cd C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
                To run a script in batch (non-interactive) mode, start a MySQL client and redirect the script as the input, as follows:
                mysql -u username -p < path-to/scriptName.sql
                The input redirection operator '<' re-directs the input from the file, instead of the default standard input (i.e., keyboard). You may provide an absolute or relative path of the filename.
                For example:

                We invoke the MySQL client with user "root" in batch mode running the script yourname_assignment1.sql.

                mysql -u root -p -vvv --force –-comments < C:\Users\moela\OneDrive\Desktop\my_scripts\yourname_assignment1.sql
                You could also redirect the output to a text file (via the output redirection operator '>'), for example,
                mysql -u username -p -vvv < path-to/scriptName.sql > path-to/ouput.txt
                For example:

                We invoke the MySQL client with user "root" in batch mode running the script yourname_assignment1.sql and redirect the output to a text file yourname_assignment1.txt

                mysql -u root -p -vvv --force –-comments < C:\Users\moela\OneDrive\Desktop\my_scripts\yourname_assignment1.sql > C:\Users\moela\OneDrive\Desktop\my_scripts\yourname_assignment1.txt
                The Options on the Command Line

                -u: This is for your username.
                -p: This is to indicate that you will supply a password when asked.
                -vvv: Specify how much information to display. We use the -vvv option to see the queries that are being run and the output formatted as rows and columns.
                --Force: This forces your script to continue to run, even if you have an error in your script.
                --comments: We include a --comments option on the command line to see the comments.

                yourname_assignment1.pdfDownload yourname_assignment1.pdf
                Read your .txt file and verify it contains the following:

                the set commands as provided in the template
                your name as a comment
                the query number for each query as a comment
                the SQL query(queries) needed at each step
                the output for each step
                Submission Instructions:
                For each of the queries above, submit both the query and result from running the query. Please use the provided SQL file to write your
                Change the name of the file sql to your name (first name initial and last name). The script file name must follow the pattern hibrahim_assignment1.sql and the .txt file will have the same name with a .txt extension hibrahim_assignment1.txt.
                Zip the two files together to create one compressed file. Example: hibrahim_assignment1.zip
                Submit the zipped file containing the script and output .txt via
                Remember to include the query number as a comment at each step.
                Read your output .txt file before submitting.

                Section 1 | Summary of Database Systems
                Recap
                In this lesson, you should have learned how to:

                Differentiate between data and information
                Define database
                Describe the elements of a database management system(DBMS)
                Identify the transformations in computing
                Identify business and industry examples where database applications are used
                Start MySQL
                Use the MySQL command line client window
                Set up your MySQL account
                Use interactive queries to retrieve data from the database
                Key Terms
                Data: collected facts about atopic or item

                Information: the result of combining,comparing, and performing calculations on data

                Database: A database is a centralized and structured set of data stored on a computer system. A database is an organized collection of information. A database is usually managed by a Database Administrator (DBA). 

                Relational Databases: A relational database stores information in tables with rows and columns.

                Non-relational database: A non-relational database is a type of database that represents and stores data in a variety of forms and structures. 

                Database Management: Database management is the maintenance of information (data) stored in a computer system. Not managing your database can result in redundant and contradictory information, which can cause integrity issues for a business.

                Database Management System: A DBMS is software that controls the storage,organization, and retrieval of data

                Table: A table is a collection of records.

                Row: A row is called a record (or instance).

                Column: A column is referred to as a field (or attribute).

                MySQL: a relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store, retrieve, modify, and manage tabular databases. 

                User Interface: the visual component of apps, websites, and software. 

                MySQL Workbench: MySQL Workbench is a tool that allows users to work with databases and SQL. MySQL Workbench enables users to write queries, run queries, store databases, make new databases, pull data, store data, make new data, and much more. 

                SQL Comment: text that will not run as part of the SQL statement. Comments are typically added to explain part(s) of an SQL statement.

                SQL Script: the file that contains SQL queries and comments.

                What's Next?
                In next module, you will learn about SQL, the language that allows you to communicate with your database.  You will examine ways to sort data and use SQL functions to count rows and calculate totals. You will also learn about a special feature of SQL that lets you nest SELECT commands by placing one SELECT command inside another.
